## Results:

Below is a table of this job's results, obtained by running the benchmarks found in
[TuringLang/TuringBenchmarks](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringBenchmarks). The table shows the time ratio of the 2 Turing commits benchmarked. A ratio greater than `1.0` denotes a possible regression (marked with :x:), while a ratio less than `1.0` denotes a possible improvement (marked with :white_check_mark:). Results are subject to noise so small fluctuations around `1.0` may be ignored.
